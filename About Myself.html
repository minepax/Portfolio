    My family has registered accounts in the World Cube Association and we have participated in a few speedcubing competitions although not recently. Few highlights are when my sister set the record for 3x3 in UAE back in 2009 and my dad placing first in the Dubai Open 2009 Competition. All times have been performed in WCA sanctioned competitions in Dubai, they have been authorised and registered in the WCA website.<br><br>
